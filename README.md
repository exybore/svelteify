Welcome on the Svelteify repository ! It's a young framework which provides Material components using the Svelte framework. It is :

- **Beautiful :** the framework works with the stylesheet of <a href="https://github.com/vuetifyjs/vuetify">Vuetify</a>, which provides clean components
- **Customizable :** you can configure colors used across the application, and a dark mode. Moreover, you can choose which component to use.
- **Dependencies-less :** the library includes all the compiled JavaScript and CSS, so you don't have to install anything

Check out the [main package](packages/svelteify) !
